                    <p class="paragraph">Nestled in the heart of our beloved town, the story of our muffin bakery began with a simple dream shared between two lifelong friends. 
                    Inspired by our cherished childhood memories of baking with our grandparents and fueled by a passion for bringing joy to people's lives 
                    through food, we embarked on a journey to create a bakery that felt like home. After years of perfecting our craft, experimenting with 
                    flavors, and sourcing the finest loc., our dream finally materialized into the cozy, aromatic haven that is now the town's go-to spot 
                    for freshly baked muffins. Our bakery stands as a testament to the power of friendship, the warmth of community, and the universal love 
                    for comfort food. Each muffin we bake is a piece of our story, lovingly prepared to bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart.</p>

                        on the button. The code location.href='recipes.html'; inside the onclick attribute tells the web browser to navigate to the "recipes.html" page.
